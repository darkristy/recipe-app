		instructions:
			"1. First let's get our seasoning squared away. In a small bowl mix spices and set aside, then zest the lemon. and combine 1 teaspoon of it with 1 minced garlic clove; set aside.\r\n2. Season both sides of chicken pieces with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat until beginning to smoke. Brown the chicken pieces skin side down in single layer until deep golden, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, flip the chicken pieces over and brown the other side, about 4 minutes more.\r\n3. Transfer the chicken to a large plate; when cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and discard. Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan, reduce the heat to medium, and add the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they have browned at the edges but still retain their shape, 5 to 7 minutes (add a few tablespoons of water if the pan gets too dark).\r\n4. Add the remaining minced garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the spices and flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the broth, honey, remaining lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon salt, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits.\r\n5. Add the chicken (with any accumulated juices) back in, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Scatter the carrots around the chicken, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the carrots are tender-crisp, about 10 minutes more. Add the olives, garlic-zest mixture, cilantro, and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Lastly, stir to combine and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.",
